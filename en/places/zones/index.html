        Visit accompanied by Architect António Choupina
        
        At Boa Nova there was only cliffs and a very beautiful sea view. Sometimes architecture has this rare but defying quality of making nature even more perfect and that’s what happened with the work of a young Álvaro Siza Vieira, in 1958. Great opportunity to revisit this work, now totally recovered by the architect, and adapted to become a restaurant. The visit will be made in between the restaurant’s service, also awarded, waiting for that special day when we can sit at a table.

        Belonging to the sea, a lighthouse is a construction made to be detected at a distance and to see further away. It also serves to warn the seamen in order for them to arrive to shore safely. In a time of blind confidence in GPS and the sophisticated telecommunication systems, it is the last resort to guarantee a safe navigation, in the eventuality of all else falling. To visit the Leça Lighthouse and go up its almost 50 meters of height is like stepping into another time, in a watchmaker’s piece, where old mechanisms are immaculately maintained by the continuous zeal of lighthouse keepers.

        It is said that architecture is an immersive experience. Few examples will attest to it better that this beautiful pool in Leça da Palmeira. As an old and diligent summer friend, this pool is made of bone and muscle, rough concrete and wood dried up by salt and burnt oil. The changing rooms, covered by a greenish copper, hide bathers from indiscrete onlookers passing in the street. On the other side, the tank is a portion of mild sea whose geometry was found in the middle of the rocks.

        The weird and set-like building on the South “molhe” of the Leixões Port, is more important than its functions: it’s an open door to cruise chips that visit us and a lab for the investigation of the seas. More important than its peculiar shape, is the possibility of allowing the Port to be integrated in the city’s life, that the so called “molhe” can convert itself in a public space and that its roof can become an auditorium to the most extraordinary show: the sight of the ocean.

        Visit accompanied by Architect Maria Milano
        
        A conversion of an old bank branch, actually, of two, in a design research and promotion centre, was more than a simple change of use. Meanwhile through Rua de Brito Capelo, one of the main arteries of Matosinhos, it’s possible to pass by the old service counters, go into França Júnior Street and understand the similarities between the two facades drawn in 1937 by Manuel Fernandes de Sá. In the reconversion, by Maria Milano, the first floor becomes thereby a possibility of connection between the two streets with an inside patio. From the exhibiting of objects, studio work and the housing of guests, the two buildings have now a more affable and urban use.

        After an intelligent and sensitive rehabilitation, of the modern building originally drawn by ARS-arquitectos, the Municipal Matosinhos Market is a happy example of the cohabitation of traditional ways of commerce, maintaining the prominence of the fresh produce market. The traditional market cohabitates with the creative industries housed here, under the impressive reinforced concrete parabolic dome. Once again the market is a place of meetings and strolls, a space to eat, work and learn.

        Visit accompanied by Architect Nuno Graça Moura
        
        These houses by Eduardo Souto Moura are situated in a promontory over the terminal of containers of the Port of Leixões. These ten houses are not there to oversee the comings and goings of boats or the movement of the cranes. They are not there to see or be seen. On the contrary, they are turned onto themselves as if nothing else was there, beyond their high walls. For one day, at least, we are invited to get to know the secret garden that is a small made up landscape, as if it was carved on the inside of a perimeter of fine walls and windows.

        Visit accompanied by Architect João Paulo Rapagão
        
        Álvaro Siza’s first work, designed even before he had graduated, is the portrait of a time when the teaching of architecture would extend itself in the offices of the masters. From this first built exercise, we can see what the posture of the most important name in Portuguese architecture throughout his career would be: even though they form a group, each one of these houses is an opportunity for the architect to experiment with different project themes, materials and references to history, without ever giving up creating new things. It is exciting to get to know this house, still inhabited by its original client, and once again celebrate Álvaro Siza that, in more than 60 years of work, is still a student of architecture.

        During more than one hundred years of existence, this small palace has served many uses, from home to library, to housing the headquarters of several associations. It makes sense that its future fate will be serving the County’s House of Memory. The building that will now open its doors is empty at the moment, after many necessary infrastructure and accessibility renovation works. The sensibility of this intervention, coordinated by Ana Crista from the services of the Municipality, maintained the essential original characteristics (decorated ceilings, tiles and woods). Before this palace becomes an exhibition space, this is a unique opportunity to look for the memories that the building keeps in itself.

        The Real Companhia Vinícola building dates from the end of the 19th Century. It was the first construction to house, almost in its entirety, the rectangle drawn in the Matosinhos Plan by Licínio Guimarães, that defined a New York grid to implement the canning factories and other industries. It was also the last building to resist the recent unbridled occupation of the interior of the blocks. A classified building, recovered just in time by Guilherme Machado Vaz from the Matosinhos Municipality, it will be the new home of the Casa da Arquitectura. A house to better preserve, study and promote the architectural archives entrusted to it. It will also be the house of other songs, other arts and a cosmopolitan place, that the city will appreciate.

        This park is the home of the Metro carriages that are not in use. It is also from here that the Centralized Commander Post controls a 70 km long network. This visit is a rare opportunity to visit a place that is normally closed to the public. Come and get to know better how the transport system works, one that changed radically the day-to-day of Porto’s metropolitan area.

        The school has as its main goal to educate citizens. Because of that it belongs to the city. In this urban area in transition, in the frontier between Porto and Matosinhos, rural fragments get mixed up between small houses and residential buildings. Even if closed on itself, the building relates to these different scales, creating in its interior a qualified atmosphere where the city lurks above the brick walls.

        This house was idealized during decades by the couple Carlos Alberto Cabral and his French wife Blache Dubin, who made their life project the construction and specific design of each one of its pieces and each one of its rooms. A Cosmopolitan couple, they gave the project to Charles Siclis, accompanied by Marques da Silva. A stage-like palace to present and host, Casa de Serralves was already a house of culture before it became a museum. Open to the public, it is a house whose singularity and beauty should no doubt be preserved. It is always worth it to go back to the origins of Serralves, to discover and rediscover the different architectures that it entails, go up to the chapel tower and imagine a vie en rose.

        Visit accompanied by Architect Pedro Oliveira
        
        This intervention by Carrilho da Graça and Inês Lobo combines the renovation of a 1920s building with the construction of an annex in a new pavilion. The great glass surfaces and the resorting to noble materials like marble combined with other more rough (fair-faced concrete or galvanized steel) tell in a didactic way, the tale of the process of construction, or was this not a construction company. The transformation of small palaces at Avenida da Boavista in administrative buildings represents the last of several stages of the history of this avenue. As a gift to the visitor, this is one of the best examples that it is possible in a contemporary design to reinterpret the sophistication of a pre-existing language.

        Visit accompanied by Architect Graça Correia
        
        Houses built in the street front are common in Porto, hiding indoor gardens that, on the whole, transform the block in a private pillow of green, with support annexes, here and there. The Correia Ragazzi house tries to subvert this typology: the annexes at the end of the garden are the extension of the house itself. The idea of interior is reinforced with the main elevations completely closed off and covered with tiles, and the garden becoming an elegant patio and water tank. A typological essay with a surprising result.

        The Aleixo office building is certainly the only place in the world where two Pritzker Awards divide a condo, in a sort of “co-op” of architects and engineers. The land bought, the “co-operatives” made a competition between Fernando Távora, Álvaro Siza and Eduardo Souto Moura, and the collective decided the winner would be Siza. The building of Siza is perfectly identifiable, on a higher level than the river and Ouro Street. Besides going in the building and its common spaces, the visitors will have the unique opportunity to visit the office of Souto Moura, that opens up generously its doors.

        Visit accompanied by Architect António Leitão Barbosa
        
        It seems that this farm was destined to stay forever confined and incomplete. The VCI construction was the last nail in the coffin that isolated this remarkable house, never finished, amongst common buildings and a freeway. The recent intervention, done by António Barbosa, is an example in the ption of the original building systems as well as in the audacity of the “launching” of a glass volume of contemporary design. Seen on the inside, for the kaleidoscopic effect that it provokes, we can forget momentarily the nearby hospital and the noise of the cars passing by in high-speed. It is fundamental to walk the gardens, go up to the tower and look to the other side of the road to the fantasy-like cylindrical tower with which Nasoni topped off what he thought would remain as a group forever.

        The people that meet up everyday at the bar in Casa da Música, the skaters that slide in its travertine marble square, or the ones that have seen its silhouette painted on the side of a tourist bus, have already noticed that the city has gained more than just a concert hall. Architects don’t just design shapes. They invite visitants to see or to revisit this irregular polyhedron, in the way that a building can definitely contribute to the urban dynamic much more extensively than the program it houses.

        Visit accompanied by Architect Rui Neto
        
        The present building of the OA headquarters is the result of a strong corporate effort, during 15 years of work and investment. Subject to a competition amongst peers, the winning project by collective NPS Architects solves brilliantly the recuperation, reconversion and the construction from scratch for the public program. The visitors will see an abandoned bourgeois house that has been developed to have a prestigious use. It is an opportunity to remind oneself that it’s only up to architects the making of architecture.

        Even if just for a short period of time, this Inn is the home of those who don’t have a home. The renovation made by Nuno Valentim Atelier is an example where the contribution of the work of the architects has an extraordinary effect in the management of resources and technical systems, in a work that went on with the Inn running normally. With few means it was possible to make obvious the most elementary function of architecture: to supply a ceiling to those in need. And this shows that architecture is an inclusive activity, social and political, that is important to promote.

        The rehabilitation project of a building is an exercise that confirms the remarkable ability to adapt of the nineteenth century house. Where before were three dwellings it was possible to make five without altering the original structure and preserving its essential    compartmentalising. In one building different ways of living in the city are possible: an old tenant was maintained, new owners arrived and it was also possible to create three units of temporary accommodation. The great innovation of this house can be found in the glass façade of the patio made by recycling old woodwork, which creates an agreeable winter garden.

        There are streets that deserve to be seen from the back. Bandeirinha Street is one of them. Four architects, business partners and friends, António Portugal, Anne Vermeille, José Maria Reis and Isabel Sereno, found a property too big for just one house, or even two. They decided, because of that, to join the common office with the houses. The building’s width was divided in two halves, exactly symmetrical. Each house develops in several floors, always around a central body. All designed with exemplary detail, each floor has a function and the rooms have no doors. The two families share the wonderful garden, the continuation of the Virtudes romantic garden: an unexpected platform with a breath-taking view of Porto, the city and the river.

        The great reputation of scientific research in our country led the University of Porto to submit to competition the architectural design of one of the biggest research centres of the Ciência do Porto. Serôdio and Furtado are used to programs of this nature, in which technology and sophistication have to be solved with pragmatism, with solutions that leave no margin for doubt. When we go in we immediately have the perception that the logic of this concrete architecture could be the same of the big American research centres: effective and amiable.

        This project by Viana de Lima, whose first drawings go back to the 1960s, is pioneering in many respects. It is one of the first buildings to be set in the university campus of Asprela, that in the following years became the student city of Porto. It distinguishes itself, naturally, for the shameless modernity of its design, expressed in the large volumes in seeming concrete. In its interior, the wideness of the spaces are still surprising, with a highlight on the “Room of 70 meters”, the extreme height of the Main Hall, the wide glass corridors and the inside patios. The intelligence in the organization of the spaces, the attention to detail and the quality of construction, make it, more than 40 years passed, still a reference work that deserves to be maintained and revisited.

        Besides being the place where a precious gift is collected and kept, this project of studio ARX opens up the inside of a block, really near Quinta do Covelo. It offers the city a new green space with public access. In plain sight of the discombobulated patios of the nearby houses, the building seems to replicate the materials and textures of the surrounding constructions: stone, steal, zinc and glass, contrasting with the aseptic inside, specific to its laboratory function.

        This urban house that two architects, Ana Cláudia Monteiro and Vitor Oliveira, designed to be their own home is a construction with a contemporary language, but that has learned a lot with old houses: in the way its organised and lives a narrow and profound space. Its façade is transparent. However, during the day and with the different seasons, an elaborate game of shutters makes the relationship between the inside, pristinely white, and the exterior, one of constant alteration. The intensity of the light and temperature can be controlled, but also what we can see from the inside and what is seen from the outside.

        Visit accompanied by Architect José Carlos Loureiro
        
        Following other examples in the country, this housing complex looks for a synthesis between The Modernist Movement proposals – construction in height, retreat in relation to the street and the freeing of green spaces of common use, resorting to elements of traditional architecture. The simultaneous use of exposed concrete with stone structures, the tile coating and the simulation of a roof tile way up above, is the visible expression of that will. On the inside, however, that attempt is more than merely formal as one can see by the large space given to common areas that promote meetings and strengthen neighbourhood relationships.

        There is always ghost-like spaces in cities. Everyone knows that hospices exist but they rarely know the inside of them. This huge building, in particular, is a fine project by Manuel d’Almeida Ribeiro inaugurated in 1883. This building is the result of a major donation by Conde Ferreira and its project was inspired by the Hospice of D. Pedro II in Rio de Janeiro. An area of 12 hectares would allow besides the construction of the Hospital for the “furious” or the “alienated”, the construction of gardens, patios and vegetable gardens that distinguish the different methods of psychiatric treatment in this house. Conde Ferreira Hospital, kindly, opens its doors to the city more and more and to visit, is a way to demystify mental health and understand how much architecture contributes to the construction of this unique universe.

        The English word Lodge, a temporary house by definition, is now part of our vocabulary in Portuguese, a reflection of the times we are living in. Made for one family only, the capacity of this kind of centennial houses is tested, whether they can adapt into tourist accommodation. The author of this transformation, Ren Ito, is a Japanese that came to Portugal in 2003 for a short stay and ended up staying to this day. He has become for some years now an agent of transformation in the city. This work is symptomatic of this recent movement of people in transit in Porto, of how they see our reality and the permanent marks they leave by passing through.

        The visit to this neighbourhood and to this part of the city comes in a moment of change, after the demolition of the problematic blocks of “Tarrafal” and the on-going building work to rehabilitate the old neighbourhood of small houses. The houses built from scratch in black brick, have been already concluded and delivered. In this phase of construction it is easy to understand the qualities that Nuno Brandão Costa’s project wants to maintain – the small scale, the low density and, mainly, keeping the old neighbourhood relationships alive, that we can attest by the fact that almost all the residents wanted to stay in the neighbourhood. This work is also an example of the capacity of architects in managing small budgets to obtain maximum effect in comfort and dignity.

        This building is one of the biggest in Porto, it can hold more than 50 thousand supporters, every other week. It abled an urban plan that was postponed due to the recent economical crisis, and an important urban infrastructure arrangement: a highway junction, a shopping centre and a metro station to the oriental side of the city. Hic sunt dracones, (there are dragons here) is a sentence inscribed in old maps to signal unknown territories. Come and get to know the backstage of soccer, while having a peek to a part of Porto that is transforming.

        As a consequence of the expansion of cities with the industrial age in the 19th Century, the municipal slaughterhouses functioned as a fundamental instrument for the salubrity of the urban environment and its inhabitants. They are located, therefore, at the limits of the city normally in large buildings. Having cessed its function in the 1990, it has the potential today of feeding a renovation of the urban and cultural dynamics of Porto. While we wait for this ambitious project to be finished, it’s worth to visit this enormous structure, gifted with an unexpected design.

        The reconversion of these two warehouses, of a series of eleven, marks the beginning of the process of an ongoing transformation where, by the initiative of each owner, distinct ways in use and design are being rehearsed. In this case it is possible to see two different approaches: one works as an art gallery and space for artistic residencies and the other is open to more temporary and informal appropriations. These examples of positive contamination in which the effects of revitalisation go beyond the private limits of each intervention.

        The city welcomes more and more temporary residents, therefore, it is natural that also the houses change. This old warehouse on the oriental side tries out an adaptation model for that flowing population, that can isolate themselves in the suspended bedrooms or come down to the ground floor to the large nave to cook and live. It is another example of the typological variation that warehouses in this area of Campanhã have been suffering and that are starting to define a new housing neighbourhood and a cultural hub, in an area previously forgotten.

        Behind the red doors of one of the old warehouses at Miraflor street lays a house installed here with resources that only at first glance are simple. The granite walls are now exposed, as well as the water and light installations. The only nave is divided by successive glass planes: a garage, an open air patio and the house, with a bedroom on a mezzanine. Besides two small blocks in black brick, everything else is mobile as if a kitchen, a tree on wheels, a motorcycle or a sofa could be arranged in different ways, depending on the weather or the lodgers humour.

        What life exists in the city of the dead? Mainly the memories of those that left us and the ones that take care of it to keep it present. In the works that are their final address, many times with remarkable architectural and artistic quality, are many of the stories of the city of the living: the wealth and opulence of some of their inhabitants perpetuated in the family tombs, neo gothic and modern, as well as the interrupted construction of a monumental church that would serve as connection to S. Vítor Street. We invite you to visit, at night, the first public cemetery of Porto, founded in 1839, and find out a place where the city’s memories are kept.

        The Porto islands, mainly the S. Vítor ones are a study theme about the transformation of the city. It is known that this precarious form of housing still persists today and this example, by author Bernardo Amaral, reminds us that there is still a lot to study, discuss and learn. This island, revisited, is an example of chirurgical intervention, where small constructions were demolished to reveal the original structure of exterior common spaces. In the same few compartments where before several families lived, united by an exterior corridor, the frontiers between sleeping, eating, cooking and bathing spaces are now blurred. A small community was created here, that proposes to question what it is to live together.

        Besides allowing faster and more convenient connections inside Porto’s Metropolitan Area, the construction of the Metro also re-established connections in time that we had thought were lost. In the excavation of one the deeper stations in the network, in a place that because it was frequently flooded was called Poço das Patas [Duck Well], a fountain was discovered with the curious name of Mijavelhas [Old Woman’s Piss]. The archaeological find was permanently integrated in Eduardo Souto de Moura’s design of one of the five floors of this station. This way, to travel in the underground becomes at the same time, a journey through the city’s best contemporary architecture and a journey through time.

        When it comes to the field of rehabilitation of our built heritage, we should remember that it is not always necessary to demolish everything or maintain only the façade and build again its interior. In these houses what is proposed is a radically alternative approach where, with the exception of the new elements introduced with great precision, everything else is maintained: the wood structure, the plaster and wood work, but mainly the marks of the passing of time, the worn paint, woods and wallpaper. The visitors will be able to understand this ambiguity between complete rehabilitation or a surgical intervention. Even if it might seem simply like a nostalgic and romantic stance, rapidly one can refute the argument when we see that all this allows also considerable savings in construction costs.

        Porto’s typography has areas, like the one in Bonjardim, in which buildings bump against cliffs. A blue collar area, the islands organise themselves in terraces from the bourgeois façade to the street, which hid, so to speak, the misery of the several precarious constructions that were lined in the thresholds of a never-ending staircase. Lúcia Batista’s work started by the street and the square, and the intention to renovate a house resulted in the recovery of a beautiful Baroque fountain, that was abandoned, and giving that space back to the public promenade. In the design of the four houses, overlapping and intersecting, everything is a sensitivity exercise, of culture and of architecture, that is worth your visit.

        A year before the beginning of the construction of this building, Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement only still had 23 letters in its alphabet. The “K” and the “W” were odd letters for our language just as the building that Arménio Losa and Cassiano Barbosa projected was strangely modern. The building was at, the then new, Sá da Bandeira street where the headquarters of the German automobile company would be housed. At the DKW the innovations aren’t merely aesthetic. Housing, commerce, offices and parking, live together in the same structure with independent entries. To go up the spiral stairs, go through the indoor galleries and visit its apartments, reveal spaces and a way to inhabit that even today is surprising.

        The origin of this real estate goes back to the nineteen century (1844). Its construction was ordered by a rich merchant, and right away it was the stage of opulent parties and, generally, a way of showing off the economic power of its owner. The owners that followed continued and reinforced its vocation – to serve the arts. In its current state, and in possession of the Municipality, it has become an example of support given by civil society and several patrons around the enthusiasm of a theatre company and an arts school that are housed here. The architects’ work was also part of this movement, giving the building excellent technical conditions, respecting it and highlighting its original qualities.

        The headquarters of the Porto Municipality has, since the 1920s, an important symbolic function, finishing off the top of Aliados Avenue like a set, where its tower rises, challenging, before the prominence of the Clérigos Tower. Before this representational intent, the refinement of its interiors and the magnificent terrace over the city, remain for many a mystery. We invite you once again to investigate a space that has been on the Open House itinerary since its beginning.

        Right in the middle of Avenida dos Aliados, in the noblest part of the city, this elegant corner building designed by Pardal Monteiro and belonging to the State’s bank shares and promotes cultural production, which is in a way, also a common good. Culturgest, in Lisbon and Porto, has become a major institution in the promotion of the arts. Besides the inside atrium with an octagonal plan with double height, richly and colourfully decorated, the visit will go down to the vault and up to the roof.

        Only really the persistence and stubbornness of the people of Porto can be stronger than the toughness of its granite structures. The same stubbornness in maintaining the port traffic in the Douro river made possible the opening of a railroad way between Alfândega and Campanhã. With the definite passing of this function to Leixões, this line was disabled and became an open wound. It is time to heal it and think how can the reactivation of this connection serve as support to a necessary recovery of this part of the city.

        The sets for a theatre are always a simulacrum of another reality, hiding its fragile and precarious materiality. In these workshops, by Paulo Providência, sets are built a few meters away from S. João Theatre. The façade is everything but light, and game and illusion are present: the stone-like panels that seem to move, or the walls that in the end become doors. The rigorous sensibility of this project adds contemporary value to the extraordinary heritage of the theatre building. This visit is also an opportunity to get to know some secrets on the construction of a show.

        This huge white building with granite frames highlighted at the top of Morro da Sé is a fundamental part of the city’s history and its postcard. In August last year, after six hundred years of existence, the house of the Bishops of Porto opened its doors regularly to the public, and Open House Porto could not let that go. It’s an opportunity to know the refinements that you would expect from a palace: a monumental staircase, rich tapestry, furniture made with precious woods or mirrors with gold carving, but also the spaces where the Bishop of Porto and other members of the church live daily and see the view from the big windows.

        This small house doesn’t have as an address a street, but a steep staircase, the Escada das Verdades [Stairs of Truth], that connects Ribeira to the Sé. Its 80 square meters divide themselves in a succession of four floors. To go through them, therefore, is like an extension of the stairs on the outside. And just like the outside, each floor offers a different space, each one relating to a garden patio, with distinct perspectives over the Douro river. The project functions as an archaeology exercise that starts, below, with the exposed rock bed that becomes more and more coated as we go up.

        Only the façade and granite lateral gables remain, of the housing building that existed here near Calçada da Serra and leaning against a scarp. Within these limits, and in order to make 6 touristic apartments, an exposed concrete structure was inserted. In the middle of the group, divided in two halves, an inhabited wall solves the demands of this new use: with the bathrooms and the kitchens of each unit, and an elevator. The view over Porto’s ribeira that you have from the rooms is extraordinary, but from the side of the patio the intervention highlighted the scarp, exposed, that functions as a mineral scenario for the apartments that open their big windows to it.

        It is always worth it to go back to this building with its rare shape: a church and a cloister, side by side, both with a circular plan and identical dimensions. One full, one empty, one closed, one open, they are the demonstration that the laborious act of projecting in architecture can be taken in an almost ludic way. Le Corbusier would say, “architecture is a wise, correct and magnificent game under the light”. For architects it would be enough to know this work through drawing, but nothing substitutes a walk through its spaces and observing the subtleties of the variations of sunlight throughout the day.

        The installation of this barrack dates back to the beginning of the 16th Century, almost simultaneously with the construction of the Monastery. During these almost 500 years, it was of course involved in the military conflicts that most threatened the “Cidade Invicta” [never-beaten city] character that Porto is precisely most proud of. For its strategic location, it was decisive in the expulsion of Napoleon’s invading troops and in the fight that opposed liberals to absolutists. The origin of this barrack merges with the one of the monastery that, before having the name it is know for today, had also the name of São Salvador do Mundo and Salvador do Porto [Saint Saviour of the world and Porto Saviour]. The strategic position it occupies, so effective in times of war, offers a beautiful view over the city that in these more quiet times that we live in, is good to savour.

        At Serra do Pilar, and nearby Barrack and Monastery, there’s also space for science. The meteorological observatory, placed in the middle of a huge garden, just got profound improvement works that makes us think that this space could have an important role in the life of the city. The view from the roof is surprising but there are other secrets to find out: from the records of weather since the end of the 19th Century, to a American bunker that listened in to the vibrations of earth during the soviet nuclear tests that warmed another climate – the political -, in Cold War times.

        During the seven years necessary to build the S. João Bridge, it was in this building, right at the riverfront that the construction site was overseen and structural challenges were anticipated. The building itself functions as a maquette of the bridge on a smaller scale. 25 years passed from its opening to the railway, and without its main function, this construction with an unconventional anatomy – two large pillars in reinforced concrete supporting two glass volumes –, gained some autonomy and deserves to be visited for the quality of its design.

        If you can call “works of art” to special engineering pieces – bridges and viaducts –, then it is due to the work of figures like Edgar Cardoso. The second bridge that this engineer offered the city follows the legacy of its predecessors, in its technical uniqueness but also in its sculptural elegance. After all, a structure functions better if it is also beautiful. Complementing the visit to the nearby lab, go up to the bridge and walk the hollow inside of its span.

        Religious architecture is a theme that José Fernando Gonçalves studied and developed in several projects. This chapel, with a clear Nordic influence, has nevertheless certain territorial and accessibility conditions that allowed its placement on this site and landscape in a very articulated manner. The concrete and the concrete block, the wood and the stone, are the materials used in several spaces of the Program, Chapel, Mortuary Chapel and Parish Centre, in different ways, creating in each space a religious and contemplation atmosphere necessary for each one.

        António Teixeira Lopes is an important sculptor from Porto, disciple of Marques de Oliveira and Soares dos Reis, graduated from Porto’s Fine Arts Academy and Paris Beaux-Arts, as it was traditional back then. His brother, José Teixeira Lopes, architect, builds the family home, where the studio of the sculptor also functioned and where he accumulated an important collection of art objects. The house uses some decorative elements that came from the very important Gaia ceramic factories and other pieces in stone and brick that came from other buildings, resulting in the house itself becoming an exhibition object. In this county there are also the Soares dos Reis workshops, that will be rehabilitated soon, and the one of painter Pedro Olayo, in Miramar, abandoned. An unknown heritage that, on the whole, deserves to be valued.

        With its 177 meters in height, this is one of the biggest elevated structures built in the country, rising like a lighthouse, serving as a reference point to people who move within Gaia. The highest places, on top of mountains, have always been seen as sacred places, ideal for the communication between Men and the Divine. Right next to Monte da Virgem Sanctuary, a recurring pattern repeats itself, the coexisting of cult places with high potent antennas. After all, the role of favouring communication is common.

        Visit accompanied by Architect José Fernando Gonçalves
        
        It is important to visit this group of buildings in Lavadores, a good example when it comes to the occupation of the riverfront, which has happened at random, throughout the whole north cost, with gated community buildings, too big and disturbing comparing with the old summer houses. A good example of construction and also formal quality. In this case it’s the different designs of the buildings, outside green spaces, the L shape, the blades that create shadows on the west and the elevations closed off to the orient, that define this singular intervention. The grid system of the buildings allows a transparent ground floor, different typologies in each floor, and finished off with the traditional penthouse at the top with a stunning view.

        A few minutes from the city centre, this house functions as a true refuge, turned into itself, to its garden and tall trees that surround it. In terms of construction, following other experiences by Carlos Castanheira, this is a work that takes risks in exploring unusual materials in contemporary domestic constructions. The option to use “exposed concrete of rough appearance” walls, window frames and wood covering in copper, means the house can retreat from the street as wished and have a great transparency over the private exterior space. To know this private house and go through the massive concrete walls is a rare opportunity to know the inside, hidden, of a work that has awakened a lot of curiosity to passers-by.
